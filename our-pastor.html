              <div class="staffs-single__testimonial">

                <h3>Early Life</h3>
                <p>I was born in Maledi, Lungalunga Sub-county, Kwale County, Kenya to a Christian family. 
                  I undertook my O-levels in 1999 at Mazeras Boys’ High School. However, 
                  I could not further my studies due to lack of funds. Since my parents were unable to raise fees for me, 
                  I had to forego my dream of becoming an Electrical Engineer.</p>
                <p>In my heart I blamed everyone, especially those relatives who appeared well-off but did not support me in achieving my dream. 
                  Actually, it is these thoughts and events that inspired me to author a book titled “Who is To Blame?” 
                  which will be launched later in the year 2022.</p>
                <p>After my O-levels, I joined a missionary organization as a volunteer where I trained on Computer literacy and took a driving course. 
                  The skills I acquired helped me in translating contents and also driving visiting missionaries to mission fields. 
                  At the end of the year 2000, I decided to go back to my rural village in Maledi. While in the village, 
                  I joined a local church that had just started. Since I was still a novice, the Pastor helped me a lot in my spiritual growth. 
                  While at Maledi, I would do menial jobs like charcoal burning to support myself. At this point, 
                  I had accepted the fact that my dream to further my studies was aborted.</p>

                <h3>My Calling</h3>
                <p>One Saturday while I was in an overnight prayer and fasting session, a woman who had come for the kesha saw a vision.  
                  During the service on Sunday, she narrated how she saw a young man who looked exactly like me, even in the way I had dressed that Sunday. 
                  The man in the vision asked her, “Woman, why are you in darkness?” then he lit a lamp for her and disappeared. 
                  Immediately, I perceived in my heart that God had called me to dispense light to His people.</p>
                <p>I stayed in Maledi for a while until 2002 when one of my uncles decided to take me to College for Computer proficiency course in Mombasa, Kenya.</p>
                <p>While in Mombasa, I joined and served faithfully in a church until 2008 when I left due to some leadership wrangles. 
                  I found myself in a small fellowship of about seven believers in a school classroom. The fellowship had no pastor and 
                  so people would preach in turns. After four months of the fellowship's existence, Apostle Ndumbu, the Bishop of the ministry under which the fellowship operated, 
                  confirmed my pastoral calling.</p>
                <p>I was officially ordained by Apostle Ndumbu as Pastor on the 3rd of August 2008.</p>

                <h3>Family Life</h3>
                <p>I married my wife Jane N. Wanje on the 3rd of August 2006. Our Marriage was solemnized at Gongoni E.A.P.C, Kilifi County.</p>
                <p>So far, The Lord has blessed us with Four lovely children namely; 
                  <br> Moses R. Mwakaga (Male)- Born on 18th June 2007
                  <br> Eleazar K. Mwakaga (Male) - Born on 11th May 2010
                  <br> Precious M. Mwakaga (Female) - Born on 12th March 2014
                  <br> Abiathar M. Mwakaga (Male) - Born on 23rd February 2018
                </p>

                <h3>Work</h3>
                <p>After joining Kiembeni Catholic Computer College for a month, I ran out of funds and was forced to drop out.
                  I purposed not to go back to my rural village in Maledi. I got employed as an untrained teacher in a private primary school where 
                  I got peanuts for a pay. This forced me to look for other income sources during my free time.</p>
                <p>At some point, a friend started a Secondary School and asked me to volunteer as he began the school. 
                  I took up the job as a volunteer teacher for the whole of 2003. He put me on payroll in 2004, and at least the salary was better. 
                  Moreover, I conducted evening classes for a pay in student's homes. I worked happily and trusted God for prosperity.</p>
                <p>I began to undertake formal training while working and got relevant teaching Certificates. I can't underscore the fact that 
                  the job helped me acquire experience, exposure and a platform for networking.</p>
                <p>In 2012, I was able to start my own Secondary school that is running to date. Glory be to God!!</p>
                <p>I am a teacher by profession having done in service training. Since I had fully been called by God to ministry, 
                  I chose to build capacity by joining Rhema Kenya Bible Training College in 2016. I graduated with a Diploma in Ministerial Training in November 2018.</p>
                <p>Because of my classroom, teacher experience, Rhema Kenya asked me to instruct in their campuses which I continue to do to date.
                   Rhema Kenya has also taken me through Instructor's Training Programs. </p>
                <p>At the moment, I am an ongoing student of Rhema Leadership Pipeline Class taking a course in financial issues.</p>
                
                <h3>Ministry</h3>
                <p>After my ordination in 2008, I worked hard to grow the church in all aspects. Being a pastor under Soul Harvest Ministries Intl. 
                  Whose mission is to reach out and shelter the lost all around the world, I had to put on the shoes of the Gospel of Peace to the Lost</p>
                <p>Fast forward to 2011, Soul Harvest Ministries ordained me to become a Reverend. In 2013, I was appointed overseer over Mombasa Churches under the Ministry. 
                  At this time, I was overseeing some 18 churches around Mombasa. My obligation as the overseer is to help in realising the Ministries' vision through building capacity. 
                  Today, these efforts have yielded fruit and we have Soul Harvest School of Ministry in operation.</p>
                <p>On 19th of December 2021, I was ordained as Bishop by Apostle Ndumbu.</p>
